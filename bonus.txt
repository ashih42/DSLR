- Missing fields in data?  It tells ya exactly what is missing!

- Expanded many additional features from (useless) features!

- describe.py provides additional statistical measures:
	- variance
	- min
	- mode

- describe.by provides statistical measures for 5 groups:
	- All students
	- Gryffindors only
	- Hufflepuffs only
	- Ravenclaws only
	- Slytherins only

- Optional environment variable DSLR_VERBOSE=TRUE to show you real shit is happening!

- Terse but powerful vectorized operations for runtime efficiency and clean code!

- Not only does it predict a house, it also tells you %-likelihood for all 4 houses for each student!

- Noice UML class diagram! (Oh you did OOP stuff again WHY)

- Such organization! So formatting!

- I even considered implementing regularization and customizable regularization constants, but this data is already nicely partitioned by simple linear combinations of the given features, so I decided there was no need to insert additional polynomial terms from combinations of features.
