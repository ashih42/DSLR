- Missing fields in data?  It tells ya exactly what is missing!

- Expanded many additional features from (useless) features!

- describe.py provides additional statistical measures:
	- variance
	- mode

- describe.by provides statistical measures for 5 groups:
	- All students
	- Gryffindors only
	- Hufflepuffs only
	- Ravenclaws only
	- Slytherins only

- Optional environment variable DSLR_VERBOSE=TRUE to show you real shit is happening!

- Terse but powerful vectorized operations for runtime efficiency and clean code!

- Not only does it predict a house, it also tells you %-likelihood for all 4 houses for each student!

- Noice UML class diagram! (Oh you did OOP stuff again WHY)

- Such organization! So formatting!

- I considered implementing regularization and customizable regularization constants, but this data is already nicely partitioned by simple linear combinations of the given features, so there is no need to insert additional polynomial terms and then apply regularization to mitigate overfitting.

- I decided against stochastic gradient descent, as it would not be any more beneficial in thise case, since this dataset is small enough, and the logistic cost function is convex, guarantees one global min.
